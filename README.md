Home Page
Introduction: Start with a brief personal introduction highlighting your background as a data scientist/computer scientist and your programming and language skills.
Languages and Skills: Create sections for both programming languages (HTML, CSS, C, Python, R) and natural languages (Chinese, Malay, English).
About Me: Describe your journey into data science and computer science, touching on your academic background, interests, and career goals.
Portfolio Section
Projects: Showcase a few key projects where you've used different programming skills. Provide summaries and links to the projects (e.g., GitHub repositories) with clear explanations.
Example projects:
Data Science Project in Python: Display your analysis of a real-world dataset using pandas, matplotlib, or scikit-learn. Include visualizations and insights you generated.
Web Development Project (HTML/CSS): Share a sample website or web application you've built, possibly even the portfolio website itself.
Statistical Analysis in R: Include a statistical analysis project, explaining the methodology and findings.
C Programming Project: If applicable, add a project to showcase your proficiency in C. This could be a computational algorithm or a small system-level tool.
Languages Section: Showcase your multilingual skills by including some project descriptions or even blog posts in Chinese, Malay, and English.
Skills and Tools
Create a section for technical skills, highlighting proficiency in libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, ggplot2), databases, and tools like Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Git, or any relevant data science tools youâ€™ve used.
Blog or Articles
Consider adding a blog section where you share insights, tutorials, or write-ups on data science or programming topics in English, Chinese, and Malay. This can showcase both your technical and language skills.
Contact
Provide links to your LinkedIn, GitHub, or other relevant profiles, as well as an email address for potential contacts.
2. Styling Tips
Use CSS to make the portfolio visually appealing:

Consistent Theme: Pick a clean, professional theme that matches the tech-focused nature of your skills.
Highlight Projects: Use grids or cards to showcase each project, with buttons to view code or demos.
Responsive Design: Ensure the portfolio looks good on mobile and desktop.
3. Project Examples to Include
Data Analysis and Visualization in Python: Show a project analyzing a dataset (e.g., sales, weather data, or social media trends). Include Python code and visualizations.
Statistical Analysis in R: Example projects could involve regression analysis, hypothesis testing, or exploratory data analysis.
Web Development (HTML/CSS): Use your portfolio itself as an example. Include responsive layouts, animations, or unique design elements to showcase your HTML/CSS skills.
C Programming: Include an algorithm implementation (e.g., sorting algorithms, data structures) or a small program that demonstrates your understanding of C.
